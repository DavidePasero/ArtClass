README:
ArtClass is the worst weapon ever created in the history of programming.
It is a tool written in Python 3 that allows you to format your source code in a very artistic way.
Basically, you execute ArtClass.py specifying an error-free source code file of a supported language and a square-black-and-white image and the program will output the c++ code formatted in a way that resembles the input image.
Of course, the outputted source code will still be error-free.

How to execute ArtClass:
Since it's a python3 program, you can execute ArtClass with the following command:
python3 ArtClass.py

If you want, you can specify the source code file and the image file as parameters in the execution command, like in the following example:
python3 ArtClass.py path_to_source_code_file/test.cpp path_to_img/test.png

Otherwise, when you start the program you'll be asked to provide these two files. Remember to always specify the absolute path.
The outputted file will be created in the folder where the source code file is stored.
